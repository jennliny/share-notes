# Share Notes
COSI 152 Group Project Team 5

This website allows users to share their notes with each other. This solves the problem that many students face, including having unclear or incomplete notes. Using "Share Notes", students can remember the lecture better and end up with clear and complete notes as a result. The hope is that students can implement the powerful study strategy of reviewing class notes regularly.
